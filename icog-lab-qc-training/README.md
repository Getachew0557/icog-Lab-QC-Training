## Quantum Circuit with Hadamard Gate

In this experiment, a single qubit is initialized and a Hadamard gate is applied to create a superposition state. The qubit is then measured, and the measurement results are visualized using a histogram to observe the probability distribution.

## Quantum Coin Flip

This simulation models a fair coin flip using a quantum circuit. A Hadamard gate is applied to a qubit to give it equal probabilities of being measured as `0` or `1`. The probability distribution for `Heads` and `Tails` is computed and visualized.

## Bell State (Entanglement)

In this experiment, a two-qubit quantum circuit is created, where the first qubit undergoes a Hadamard transformation, followed by a CNOT gate to create an entangled Bell state. Both qubits are measured, and the results demonstrate quantum entanglement.

## Generating Plus State

The plus state \( |+\rangle \) is generated by applying a Hadamard gate to a qubit initially in the state \( |0\rangle \). The qubit is measured, and the results show the superposition state with equal probabilities for `0` and `1`.

## Theory Check-ins

- **Superposition**: Superposition allows quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously, enabling faster computation for certain problems.
- **Quantum Gates and Interference**: Quantum gates manipulate the amplitudes of quantum states, leading to constructive interference that enhances correct solutions and reduces computation time.
- **Quantum Measurement**: Measurement collapses a quantum state to a classical state, providing valuable outcomes while limiting the ability to exploit quantum superposition once the state is observed.
